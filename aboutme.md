### AI探索者与实践者
2022年11月30日，Open AI发布GPT-3.5，ChatGPT首次向公众推出(GPT-3.5通过ChatGPT揭开了面纱，ChatGPT可以涉及一系列领域，包括编程、电视剧本和科学概念等)。

我在发布后第一周便抢先注册成为了首批尝鲜用户，挤入了全球前100万分之一，如同最早的微博内测用户和公众号注册用户一样，希望自己始终保持好奇，成为新世界的体验者和探索者。

从英文翻译到文案的写作、从广告营销方案到专业性调研大纲、乃至新领域课程开发与商业计划书的撰写，还有我两个孩子的亲子教育进阶探索等，涉及到的方方面面，但凡我想到的一些问题，我都与ChatGPT展开了深入畅谈，我似乎找到了新世界大门的入口，一只脚迈进去的同时，我也希望引导更多伙伴和我一起，我从推动公司全员拥抱AI开始，一步一步展开实验推进。

我自诩为一名AI学习者、探索者与实践者，我致力于不断地探索、实验和实施各种个人和机构AI项目。我渴望发掘新的AI进展，解析它们的含义，并将这些转化为具有可复制的知识、经验及工作流。

我坚信AI的力量，不仅可以革新我们的工作，还可以增强我们生活的每一个方面。在AI时代，我看到了个人成长的无限可能，特别是个性化学习与群体智慧的创新等。我也看见每一个没有编程技术能力的个体将拥有创建个人软件的能力。

在AI的世界中，我看到了无尽的可能性和机会。我相信，通过共同的努力，我们可以将这些机会变为现实。让我们一起抓住AI时刻，塑造我们想要生活的未来！


### 终身学习者
我毕业于西安外国语大学，英语教育专业。

事实上，我在大学校园社团与社会实践的过程中发现我对其他的学科领域更感兴趣，尤其是新兴的且国内还没有一所大学有这个学科的新媒体，因为这个行业还并未成气候，所以国内也没有什么可以学习的教材乃至可以学习的教授（非常注重实践性的学科，教授们并没有实践经验）。

于是我从大二开始便独立自主通过图书馆找来所有相关的图书、买了互联网相关的书籍、找北上广一线行业从业者的博客来阅读学习、加入相关的垂直网络社区交流学习，自主学习了公关传播、数字营销和组织管理相关的知识。

在这个自主学习过程，我逐渐形成了我独创的学习方法和良性循环：`阅读-->交流-->实践-->分享`，我也成为终身学习的推崇者和实践者。

比如自己想要搭建一个个人独立博客。我就花一个礼拜看视频或者图文教程学习开源软件的应用；找这方面的专家请教经验或者到问答网站看别人的讨论文章；然后自己跟着教程做一遍，直到可以正常运行；再将自己的学习过程和经验整理成一篇指导帖分享到博客。

只要我想学习一门新学科或者新知识，我都可以借助互联网渠道找到我想学的知识、跟随行业先锋实践者学习、向世界顶尖智库学习。这样的学习并不受限于你的出生背景、你所在的地域条件、乃至你的大学排名有关，只和你的学习欲望、学习目标、学习韧劲、还有方法有关。

过去这几年，我依然通过业余时间通过[在行](https://www.zaih.com/falcon/mentors/2bhjbfp3t2q?)等知识付费平台进行公开分享。我坚信教是更好的学，通过知识结构化和产品化的方式，让大家意识到每个人都可以实现终身学习并最大化释放个人价值。

### 创业者
2011年5月，因为好友李可佳的邀请，我一周之内辞去了北京的工作。什么都没有问，我就买了当周的火车票南下去到吴越文化的发源地无锡，开启了跌跌撞撞的创业旅程。

那个时候，创业还没有像今天这样流行，只是我们都隐约觉得互联网、数字媒体、数字化进程是一个有前景的方向，加上一帮志同道合的好哥们，没考虑那么多，我们就All in投身了进去！

致力于以新思维、新技术驱动企业可持续创新的我们，也算是比较早的数字营销和数字商业探索者与实践者（我们的公司品牌就取名为[NPLUS](http://www.nplusgroup.com)，寓意Net +，N种可能性），和诸多客户一起见证了：数字营销从Minisite的流行到新浪微博的崛起；再从App的火热到微信生态的迅速崛起，再到抖音小红书等全媒体渠道的发展；我们见证了一波一波的移动互联网颠覆与新技术革新。

记得起初，我们只是一个在无锡拥有五六人的草根团队，还只是众多4A公司的技术外包供应商身份，零星的只能参与一些品牌客户的小需求委托；一步一步走来，我们的办公室已经遍布北京、上海、深圳和无锡。

我们的业务范围包括整合营销、社交媒体代运营、创意视觉设计、抖音代运营、IP&品牌联合营销、KOL营销、企微&会员代运营、数字体验设计及技术开发、AIGC业务共创等。在数英网本土综合代理商指数和广告门数字营销代理商指数上，我们均名列前茅，并多次获得金投赏、金鼠标奖、数英奖、中国数字媒体大奖、金匠奖、金旗奖和虎啸奖等荣誉。

我们始终以客户为中心，秉承新思维、新技术驱动企业可持续创新的理念，致力于为品牌创造持续的价值。展望未来，我们将依托自身多年数字营销领域的积累和经验优势，积极拥抱AIGC战略，成为一家富有创造力和AI转型能力的公司，助力品牌实现生意持续增⻓。

### 公益与社会创新者
我还非常热衷于社会活动，我于2011年5月和海外留学生一起发起创办了[CAPE全球青年实践网络](http://capechina.org)，因为创办CAPE的经历，先后作为特邀演讲嘉宾在TEDxNanjing，TEDxNingbo，798 UCCA尤伦斯当代文化中心，微软NPO IT Day等做主题演讲，被《New Younger》杂志评为2012中国青年新锐百人，入选2014《城市画报》85后青年精英榜100。

### AI Explorer

On November 30, 2022, Open AI released GPT-3.5, and ChatGPT was launched to the public for the first time (GPT-3.5 was unveiled through ChatGPT, which can cover a range of fields including programming, TV scripts, and scientific concepts).

In the first week after the release, I quickly registered to become one of the first users to try it out, squeezing into the top one millionth globally. Just like the earliest Weibo beta users and public account registrants, I hope to always stay curious and become an experimenter and explorer in this new world.

From English translation to copywriting, from advertising marketing plans to professional research outlines, to the development of new field courses and the writing of business plans, as well as the advanced exploration of parent-child education for my two children, I have had in-depth conversations with ChatGPT on every aspect I can think of. It seems that I have found the entrance to a new world. As I step in with one foot, I also hope to guide more partners to join me. I started by promoting the company's full embrace of AI and gradually carried out experiments.

I pride myself on being an AI learner, explorer, and practitioner. I am committed to constantly exploring, experimenting, and implementing various personal and institutional AI projects. I am eager to discover new AI advancements, interpret their meanings, and convert them into replicable knowledge, experiences, and workflows.

I firmly believe in the power of AI, which can not only revolutionize our work but also enhance every aspect of our lives. In the era of AI, I see infinite possibilities for personal growth, especially innovations in personalized learning and collective intelligence. I also see that every individual without programming skills will have the ability to create personal software.

In the world of AI, I see endless possibilities and opportunities. I believe that through our joint efforts, we can turn these opportunities into reality. Let's seize the moment of AI together and shape the future we want to live in!

### Lifelong Learner

I graduated from the Higher Vocational College of Xi'an International Studies University, majoring in English Education.

In fact, during my time in university clubs and social practices, I found that I was more interested in other academic fields, especially new media, an emerging field not yet offered as a subject in any domestic university. Since this industry had not yet matured, there were no textbooks or professors to learn from in China (this is a very practice-oriented subject, and the professors did not have practical experience).

Therefore, starting from my sophomore year, I independently sought all relevant books from the library, bought books related to the Internet, read blogs from industry practitioners in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, and joined relevant vertical online communities to learn. I taught myself about public relations communications, digital marketing, and organizational management.

During this process of independent learning, I gradually formed my unique learning method and positive cycle: **reading --> communication --> practice --> sharing**. I also became an advocate and practitioner of lifelong learning.

For example, if I wanted to build an independent personal blog, I would spend a week watching video or graphic tutorials to learn about open-source software applications; seek advice from experts in this field or read discussions on Q&A websites; then follow the tutorial and do it myself until it can run normally; finally, I would compile my learning process and experience into a guide post and share it on my blog.

Whenever I want to learn a new subject or knowledge, I can find what I want to learn through internet channels, follow industry pioneers and practitioners to learn, and learn from the world's top think tanks. This type of learning is not limited by your background, geographical conditions, or even your university ranking. It only relates to your desire to learn, your learning goals, your perseverance in learning, and your methods.

Over the past few years, I have continued to share publicly on paid knowledge platforms like Zaihang during my spare time. I firmly believe that teaching is a better way to learn. By structuring and productizing knowledge, I want everyone to realize that they can achieve lifelong learning and maximize their personal value.

### Entrepreneur

In May 2011, at the invitation of my friend Li Kejia, I quit my job in Beijing within a week. Without asking anything, I bought a train ticket that week and headed south to Wuxi, the birthplace of Wu-Yue culture, to embark on a bumpy entrepreneurial journey.

At that time, entrepreneurship was not as popular as it is today. We just vaguely felt that the Internet, digital media, and the digitalization process were promising directions. With a group of like-minded good friends, we didn't think too much, we just went all in!

Committed to driving sustainable innovation in enterprises with new thinking and new technologies, we were among the early explorers and practitioners of digital marketing and digital business (our company brand is named NPLUS, implying Net +, N kinds of possibilities). We witnessed with many customers: the popularity of digital marketing from Minisite to the rise of Sina Weibo; from the heat of Apps to the rapid rise of the WeChat ecosystem, to the development of all-media channels such as TikTok and Xiaohongshu; we witnessed wave after wave of mobile internet subversions and technological innovations.

I remember at the beginning, we were just a grassroots team of five or six people in Wuxi, merely a technical outsourcing supplier for many 4A companies, sporadically involved in some small demand commissions from brand customers. Step by step, our offices have now spread across Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wuxi.

Our business scope includes integrated marketing, social media operation, creative visual design, TikTok operation, IP & brand joint marketing, KOL marketing, corporate WeChat & member operation, digital experience design and technology development, AIGC business co-creation, etc. We rank among the top in both the Digital Marketing Agency Index and the Advertising Door Digital Marketing Agency Index, and have won numerous awards such as Golden Investment Award, Golden Mouse Award, Digital British Award, China Digital Media Award, Golden Craftsman Award, Golden Flag Award and Tiger Roar Award.

We always put customers at the center, adhere to the concept of new thinking and new technology driving sustainable innovation in enterprises, and are committed to creating continuous value for brands. Looking forward to the future, we will rely on our many years of accumulation and experience advantages in the field of digital marketing, actively embrace the AIGC strategy, become a company with creativity and AI transformation capabilities, and help brands achieve continuous business growth.

### Marketing Consultant

As a digital marketing consultant, I have long provided integrated marketing consulting, digital transformation, membership system construction, new media operations, social communication, creative design, and other comprehensive services for leading brands across various industries.

I have served well-known brands including Midea, Little Swan, COLMO, Huazhu Group, SMILEY, Tencent Public Welfare, TRT Health, Wyeth Nutrition, Luzhou Laojiao, Yellow Swan, CKGSB , OPPO, Nielsen, Zhongzhi, Airbnb, Freitag, Lazhou Distillery, Maxwell, The Paper News, and others.

I have served as a judge for several industry media awards such as the Digital British Award, Tiger Roar Award, Effie Award, Golden Craftsman Award, etc.

I have led the team to complete multiple innovative projects including:

* Tencent's 99 Public Welfare Day "How Many Little Red Flowers Do You Have" Interactive Creative Project
* Huazhu Group Brand Official Website Reshaping Upgrade Project
* Airbnb Host Membership System Consultation and Construction and Host Conference Communication Project
* SMILEY Social Media Matrix Operation and Campaign Project
* CCTV ✖️ The Paper News "Writing Brilliant China" H5 Project
* Wuxi Tourism Bureau - "Wuxi Creative Design Contest from the Eyes of Designers" Project
* and many more.

### Public Welfare & Social Innovator

I am also very passionate about social activities. In May 2011, I founded [CAPE](capechina.org) Global Youth Practice Network with overseas students. Because of the experience of founding CAPE, I was invited as a guest speaker at TEDxNanjing, TEDxNingbo, 798 UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Microsoft NPO IT Day and others. I was rated as one of the 2012 China Youth Newcomers by "New Younger" magazine and selected for the 2014 "City Pictorial" Post-85 Youth Elite List 100.

Based on my long-term practice in the field of youth communities, I have collaborated with partners to promote and support the landing of hundreds of youth-themed salons in more than 60 cities worldwide through social collaboration. At the same time, I have participated in and supported the initial development and landing process of innovative projects such as DFC China, ChinaHouse, Micro English Learning, in Wuxi, Living in Chaoshan and others. I have been reported by well-known media such as The Atlantic magazine, Australian National Broadcasting Corporation, South China Morning Post and Today Beijing.

In addition, I am also passionate about public welfare project practice. I have provided services including new media training and creative planning for public welfare groups such as iJoin Social Innovation Consulting, CNature Foundation, NPI, GSVC, Alashan Environmental Protection Association, Environmental Advocacy Action Network, China Public Welfare Charity Network through professional output. During my university years, I also volunteered in the operation of public welfare projects such as Woxue.net (formerly Kaifu Student Network), Hope Spring E-magazine and others.
