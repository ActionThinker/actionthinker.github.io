## Mission

The mission of the Centre for Lymphoid Cancer is to better understand the biological, genetic and environmental mechanisms that cause lymphoid cancers, the determinants of their clinical behaviour and how lymphoid cancer treatments work so that more efficient diagnostic tools and therapies can be developed to combat these cancers.


## Goals

Centre for Lymphoid Cancer maintains provincial, national and international partnerships with multi-disciplinary scientific researchers and clinicians to:

1. Accelerate the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics for the treatment of lymphoid cancers by fostering a cutting-edge multi-disciplinary research environment with a focus on clinical applications.
2. Establish an international centre for the study of lymphoid cancers.
3. Facilitate cross-disciplinary research programs focused on understanding the biological mechanisms of lymphoid cancers for the development of novel therapeutic treatments for these cancers.
4. Conduct collaborative research programs to develop a more comprehensive understanding of lymphoid cancers.
