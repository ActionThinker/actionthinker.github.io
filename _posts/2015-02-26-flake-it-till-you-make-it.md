>我想最佳的时机就是当下，而当下最佳的时机就是开始行动起来的这个时刻。

已经很久没有以这样相对严肃的方式码字了，过去的几年时间里，我多数情况下都在充当着分享文化的布道者、故事发掘者与内容策展人，在一个相对聚焦的议题下面，我总能发现这个领域最前卫的实践者，我试图说服他们，记录他们的所思所感，他们的行动观察与反思。

但是似乎，我已经很久没有亲自行动示范了，还记得大学时每天坚持写一篇网络日志给我带来源源不断的灵感，还有每周一次写总结收获的成就感，因为我活着，文字段落间都是经历故事和经验的沉淀——今儿没白活。

时间过得非常快，但是快的有一些麻木，因为一时半会儿不再能找到一种叫做刺激的东西，好像并没有什么不一样，只是觉得少了些许的男性的荷尔蒙，一种叫做执着、坚持、韧劲的东西，反观生活里充斥的更多的是安定、随意、还好，这种感觉是我最不想持久的。因为生来喜欢挑战，就要做不一样是深入骨髓和血液的东西。

索性，花了三天的时间去研究如何给自己搭建一个独立博客，逼着自己阅读纯英文的安装指南，同时学习一种超文本编辑语法，熬着夜感受创作带来的快感和幸福，趁今夜，对，就是现在。

我依然将这个博客命名为***知行合一***，有时候一种心理暗示，会催生巨大的力量，正如八年前我刚进入大学生，第一个博客的命名***行动中的思考者***，我希望自己在大学里做一个思考与行动并进的人，不仅要做思想的巨人，还要做行动的强者，而后每周阅读一本书，每周积极参与校园乃至社会实践行动，让我找到了高效学习的真正秘诀——Learning by doing。

任何成功秘诀能够发生作用的前提，都是勤奋 + 天赋，既然曾经有过些许的成绩，有了一定的悟性，但那只是不堪的过往，因为时不我待，此刻行动便是最佳的契机，做行动中的思考者，做知行合一的人。

Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?  

The truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to walk. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychic intuitives, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. Only soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure.  

At the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.  

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.
